how-to-check-if-an-object-is-a-list-or-tuple-but-not-string

ex description: 
learn how to use while and for loops, as well as assert statement and testings.

notes:
* section D- checking maximum function: 
i chose those cases since they are edge cases, where the weak spots
of a bad code might me. the edge cases i chose are:
- the list is empty
- all nums are equal and max
- nums of different types (int and float)
- 2 num are equal and max

* secrtion E- theoretical questions:
1. cyclic(123 ,321)- returns an asserterror, since lst1 is not of type list.
2. maximum([-3, -2, -1])- returns an asserterror, since number is negative.
3. maximum([1, 10, 100, ‘intro’])- returns a syntaxerror, of invalid char in identifier (’).
4. histogram(3, [1,2,3,4])- returns assertionerror, since num is not smaller than n.
5. prime_factors(0)- returns an assertionerror since n is not equal or larger than 1.
6. pairs([0,0,1,1,2,2], 2)- returns the list [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2]],
since there is no limitation to return the same pair several times, as long as
it matches the other requierments.
